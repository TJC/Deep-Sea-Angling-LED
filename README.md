Deep Sea Angling LEDs
=====================

This repository is designed to be a "sketchbook" folder for Arduino 1.6.5 and Teensyduino 1.25.
It runs with FastLED 3.1.0, which I've just copied into the libraries folder directly for you.

The system used is Teensy 3.1 controller on an OctoWS2811 adapter board.

## LED setup:

There are eight strands of LEDs, varying in length between 30 and 150 LEDs each.
At the time of writing I do not know how these are arranged or connected.

Cheers
Toby
